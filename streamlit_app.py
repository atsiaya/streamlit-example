If you have any questions, checkout our [documentation](https://docs.streamlit.io) and [community
forums](https://discuss.streamlit.io).

In the meantime, below is an example of what you can do with just a few lines of code:
"""


with st.echo(code_location='below'):
    total_points = st.slider("Number of points in spiral", 1, 5000, 2000)
    num_turns = st.slider("Number of turns in spiral", 1, 100, 9)
